.SS "desmoj\&.extensions\&.applicationDomains\&.production\&.report\&.WorkStationReporter\&.WorkStationReporter (\fBdesmoj\&.core\&.simulator\&.Reportable\fPinformationSource)"
Constructor for a new \fBWorkStationReporter\fP\&. Note that although any Reportable is accepted you should make sure that only subtypes of \fBWorkStation\fP are passed to this constructor\&. Otherwise the number of column titles and their individual headings will differ from the actual content collected by this reporter\&.

.SS "String [] desmoj\&.extensions\&.applicationDomains\&.production\&.report\&.WorkStationReporter\&.getEntries ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Returns an array of Strings each containing the data for the corresponding column in array \fCcolumns[]\fP\&. This method is fetching the data from the master and the slave queues from the \fBWorkStation\fP\&. Implement this method in a way, that an array of the same length as the columntitles is produced containing the data at the point of time this method is called by someone else to produce up-to-date information\&.

.SS "int desmoj\&.extensions\&.applicationDomains\&.production\&.report\&.WorkStationReporter\&.getNumOfSlaveQueues ()"
Returns the number of slave queues of this \fBWorkStation\fP\&. That is the number of different kinds of parts handled at this \fBWorkStation\fP\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
