.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
\fBLoading\fP is the object representing the process cooperation between a \fC\fBInternalTransporter\fP\fP or \fC\fBCrane\fP\fP process and the \fBTruck\fP or an Internal Transporter he is loading\&. It is intended that this \fBLoading\fP is used with the \fCWaitQueue\fP construct, where a \fCInernalTransporter\fP or \fC\fBCrane\fP\fP>( as a master process) is waiting for a truck or an internal transporter to load it\&. During the \fBLoading\fP the master is active and the slaves is passive\&. The unloading carried out together is described in the method \fCcooperation\fP, which can be overwritten by the user to build more complex models\&. Until now this method only models the time it takes to load the truck/ an internal transporter\&.

.SS "desmoj\&.extensions\&.applicationDomains\&.harbour\&.Loading\&.Loading (\fBModel\fPowner, Stringname, NumericalDist<?>loadTimeStream, booleanshowInTrace)"
Constructs a \fBLoading\fP process where a master ( \fC\fBInternalTransporter\fP\fP) or \fC\fBCrane\fP\fP is loading slave (\fC\fBTruck\fP\fP or \fC\fBInternalTransporter\fP\fP) in a cooperate process\&. The time it takes to load the containers (goods) is determined by the specified loadTimeStream\&.

\fBParameters:\fP

\fIowner\fP desmoj\&.Model : The model this \fBLoading\fP is associated to\&.

\fIname\fP java\&.lang\&.String : the name of this \fBLoading\fP\&.

\fIloadTimeStream\fP NumericalDist<?> : The random number stream determining the time it takes to load the containers\&.

.SS "void desmoj\&.extensions\&.applicationDomains\&.harbour\&.Loading\&.cooperation (\fBSimProcess\fPmaster, \fBSimProcess\fPslave)\fC [protected]\fP"
This method describes the loading process carried out by the master process (some kind of \fC\fBInternalTransporter\fP\fP or \fC\fBCrane\fP\fP)\&. In this simple case only the time it takes to load the containers (goods) is taken into consideration\&. If the user building the model has to implement a more complex behavior, he has to overwrite this method in a subclass\&. The time it takes to load the containers (goods) is obtained from the method \fC\fBgetLoadTimeSample()\fP\fP\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fImaster\fP SimProcess : The master process which really loads the cooperation\&. Should be a subclass of \fC\fBInternalTransporter\fP\fP or \fC\fBCrane\fP\fP\&. 
.br
\fIslave\fP SimProcess : The slave process which is lead through the cooperation by the master\&. Should be a subclass of \fC\fBInternalTransporter\fP\fP or \fC\fBTruck\fP\fP\&.

.SS "\fBSimTime\fP desmoj\&.extensions\&.applicationDomains\&.harbour\&.Loading\&.getLoadTimeSample ()\fC [protected]\fP"
Returns a \fCSimTime\fP object representing the time it takes to load the containers (goods) with the transporter or crane\&. The time is taken from the given random number stream loadTimeStream\&.
