Constructor for a new \fBStockReporter\fP\&. Note that although any Reportable is accepted you should make sure that only subtypes of \fBStock\fP are passed to this constructor\&. Otherwise the number of column titles and their individual headings will differ from the actual content collected by this reporter\&.
