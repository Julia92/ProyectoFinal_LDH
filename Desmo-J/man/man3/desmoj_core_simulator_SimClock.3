.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The simulation clock shows the actual simulation time\&. The actual simulation time can be polled by any object but can only be set by the scheduler responsible for the actual model\&. The simulation clock is extending class \fCjava\&.util\&.Observable\fP thus representing the 'observable' part in a 'observer'-design pattern as described in [Gamm95] page 107\&. This enables observers to register themselves at the simulation clock to be notified whenever the simulation time changes\&. This can be easily used to provide fully automatic statistical counters\&. Each time the simulation time changes, a counter registered at the simulation clock is notofied and can poll the value it is observing (most likely from a special \fCValueSupplier\fP object)\&. This way, no explicit calls for the counter to update its observed value are needed\&. Note that on the other hand this might reduce performance in comparison to explicit update call since the value under observation might not change each time the simulation time is changed\&.
