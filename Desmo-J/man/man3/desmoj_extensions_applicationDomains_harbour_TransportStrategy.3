.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A \fBTransportStrategy\fP is an interface and presents the strategy that a transporter control uses by the assigning of the jobs to transporters\&. The method getJobs (ProcessQueue Transporter, Queue Jobs) that gives the transport control the pairs of the assigned jobs with their transporters - \fCTransporterJobs\fP must be implemented by the user in a class that implements \fBTransportStrategy\fP to define the strategy which will be used by the transporter control\&. \fBTransportStrategy\fP is part of the strategy design pattern as described in [Gamm97] page 333 in which it represents the strategy interface\&.
