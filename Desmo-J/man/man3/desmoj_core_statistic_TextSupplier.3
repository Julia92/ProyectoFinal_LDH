.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Supplies observers with texts of their interest\&. It resembles the 'observable' part of the observer pattern as described in [Gamm95]\&. Thus it extends the standard 'Observable' class provided by the Java\&.util package\&. <br There are two possible ways to have other objects register changes of another object's status: <ol <liCall the <code'update(String updateStr)'</codemethod of an observer to pass the String to be counted directly to one other object interested\&. Using the direct call allows easy passing of a String to a single observer\&. No instance of this <codeTextSupplier</codeclass is needed using direct passing of Strings\&.</li <liUsing the <codeTextSupplier</codeto publish the information to interested observers requires you to derive a class and implement the call of the observer's <codeupdate(Observable, Object)</codemethod with the required texts\&. This way of passing Strings involves more code to be written, but offer the potential to have multiple observers and change the number of observers during runtime\&. These options are not available when using the simpler version above\&.</li </ol

.SS "desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.TextSupplier\&.TextSupplier (Stringname)"
Constructs a simple \fBTextSupplier\fP by giving it a name\&. 
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "String desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.TextSupplier\&.getName ()"
Returns the name of the named object\&. This is the same name displayed in reports and trace files when this named object is shown in those reports or trace files\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
java\&.lang\&.String : The name of the named object\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "String desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.TextSupplier\&.getQuotedName ()"
Returns the quoted name of the named object\&. This is the name displayed in reports and trace files when this named object is shown\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
java\&.lang\&.String : The quoted name of the named object 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.TextSupplier\&.notifyStatistics (Objectarg)"
Indicates that this \fBTextSupplier\fP (as an Observable) has changed and notifies all its observers of this change providing the modified text as parameter\&. This is the 'Push-model', thus pushing the String (in the parameter <codearg</code) to the Observer (thus the <codeStatisticObject</code)\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIarg\fP Object : The Object wrapping the text with which the observers will be updated\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.TextSupplier\&.rename (StringnewName)"
Changes the name of the named object\&. This might be necessary for an automatically created named object of a user defined model, but should not be used for elements of the framework or basic objects of the user model\&. Changing names of objects while runtime will confuse any trace output and generally make traces more difficult if not impossible to follow\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fInewName\fP java\&.lang\&.String : The new name for the named object\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "abstract String desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.TextSupplier\&.text ()\fC [pure virtual]\fP"
When using the Pull-Model or the automatic update function this method must be overridden by the user in a way that it provides the text (as a <codejava\&.lang\&.String</code) desired\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
String : The String within this method\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "String desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.TextSupplier\&.toString ()"
Overrides the java\&.lang\&.Object's toString method to return the named object's name when given as parameter to a method that expects a string to be passed\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
java\&.lang\&.String : The named object's name\&.
