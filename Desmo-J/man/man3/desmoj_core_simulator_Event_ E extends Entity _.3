.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Provides the class for user defined events to change \fBa single\fP entity's internal state\&. The state of a discrete model is changed by events that occur at distinct points of simulation time\&.
.PP
For events changing the state of \fBtwo\fP or \fBthree\fP entities, refer to \fCEventOf2Entities\fP and \fCEventOf3Entities\fP\&. Events not associated to a specific entity are based on \fC\fBExternalEvent\fP\fP\&. 
.PP
For type safety it is recommended to generically assign the entity type an Event operates on by using the generic type \fCEvent<E>\fP where \fCE\fP is derived from \fC\fBEntity\fP\fP\&. 
.PP
All event object should be used only once\&. Implement the changes of state for the specific entity associated with this event by overriding the abstract method \fC\fBeventRoutine(E who)\fP\fP\&.

\fIowner\fP \fBModel\fP : The model this event is associated to

.SS "\fBEvent\fP<E> desmoj\&.core\&.simulator\&.Event< E extends \fBEntity\fP >\&.clone () throws CloneNotSupportedException"
Creates and returns a copy of this event\&. Note that subclasses have to implement the interface java\&.lang\&.Cloneable to actually use this method as otherwise, a CloneNotSupportedException will be thrown\&.

Event<E> : A copy of this event\&.

.SS "abstract void desmoj\&.core\&.simulator\&.Event< E extends \fBEntity\fP >\&.eventRoutine (Ewho)\fC [pure virtual]\fP"
Implement this abstract method to express the changes of state this event does to a single entity\&. This event is related to the entity it has been scheduled with\&. That \fBEntity\fP is given note that since class \fC\fBSimProcess\fP\fP inherits from class \fC\fBEntity\fP\fP, an event can also be given a process to operate on\&. In this case, the process is scheduled and manipulated by this event just like an entity\&.
.PP
Implement this abstract method to express the changes of state this event does to an entity (as \fC\fBSimProcess\fP\fP is a subclass of \fC\fBEntity\fP\fP, a process can be passed as well)\&. 
.PP
For type safety, it is recommended to derive your events from the generic type \fCEvent<EntityOperatingOn>\fP where \fCEntityOperatingOn\fP (which is derived from class \fC\fBEntity\fP\fP) represents the entity type your event is supposed to operate on\&. 
.PP
Should you decide to derive your event from the raw type \fCEvent\fP (which is not recommended), please take extra care in checking the given \fBEntity\fP parameter to your special eventRoutine since any subtype of \fBEntity\fP will be accepted! If your model uses several different entity types, chances are that while developing the model, wrong entity types might be passed\&.

Note that this event's point of simulation time will be set to be the same as the \fBSchedulable\fP's time\&.
