.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.simulator\&.ExternalEventStop\&.eventRoutine ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
The eventRoutine to abort an experiment\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBdesmoj\&.core\&.simulator\&.ExternalEvent\fP\&.
.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.simulator\&.ExternalEventStop\&.eventRoutine (\fBEntity\fPwho)"
Do not use this method to implement the external event's eventRoutine! This method can not be hidden due to the inheritance relationship to the class \fCEvent\fP\&. Since external events are designed to act on the model or experiment in general and are not associated to an individual \fBEntity\fP, you should use the parameterless method \fCvoid \fBeventRoutine()\fP\fP instead\&. Calling this method will result in a warning message and the parameterless method will be called\&. The given \fBEntity\fP will not be changed\&. Do not override this method in your special external events!

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.simulator\&.ExternalEventStop\&.scheduleAfter (\fBSchedulable\fPafter)"
Schedules this external event to act on the experiment or model state directly after the given \fBSchedulable\fP is already set to be activated\&. Note that this external event's point of simulation time will be set to be the same as the \fBSchedulable\fP's time\&. Thus this external event will occur directly after the given \fBSchedulable\fP but the simulation clock will not change\&. Make sure that the \fBSchedulable\fP given as parameter is actually scheduled\&.

Schedules this external event to act on the experiment or model state directly before the given \fBSchedulable\fP is already set to be activated\&. Note that this external event's point of simulation time will be set to be the same as the \fBSchedulable\fP's time\&. Thus this external event will occur directly before the given \fBSchedulable\fP but the simulation clock will not change\&. Make sure that the \fBSchedulable\fP given as parameter is actually scheduled\&.
