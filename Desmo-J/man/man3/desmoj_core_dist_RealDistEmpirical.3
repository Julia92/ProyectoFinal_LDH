.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Empirically distributed stream of pseudo random numbers of type \fCdouble\fP\&. Values produced by this distribution follow an empirical distribution which is specified by entries consisting of the observed value and the frequency (probability) this value has been observed to occur\&. These entries are made by using the \fC\fBaddEntry()\fP\fP method\&. There are a few conditions a user has to meet before actually being allowed to take a sample of this distribution\&.
