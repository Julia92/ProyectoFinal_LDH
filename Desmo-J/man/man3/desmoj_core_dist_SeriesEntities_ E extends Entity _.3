.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A series is a special distribution returning preset, user-defined entries from a list\&. This subclass of Series serves to sample entities\&. Series may be used to simulate certain non-random scenarios within the simulation or to include external sources of (preudo) random distributions
.PP
The internal list can be set to be traversed backwards and/or to repeat once its end has been reached\&.
