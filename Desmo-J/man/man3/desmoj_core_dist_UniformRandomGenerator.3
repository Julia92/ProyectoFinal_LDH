.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Interface for uniform pseudo random number generators to be used by the distribution classes to compute their samples\&. Random generators of this type must return uniform distributed double values\&. Note that two constructors have to be implemented\&. One constructor without parameters to construct a \fBUniformRandomGenerator\fP with seed zero, and another constructor with a parameter of type long to pass the initial seed value to the pseudo random generation algorithm\&.

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.dist\&.UniformRandomGenerator\&.setSeed (longseed)"
Set the seed to be used by the pseudo random number generating algorithm\&. Setting the seed to a specific value forces the random generator to produce identical streams of pseudo random numbers\&. This is necessary to ensure that experiments in simulation can be made under identical conditions, thus enabling modelers to compare results of experiments\&.
