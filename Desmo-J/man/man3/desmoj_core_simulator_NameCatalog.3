Keeps track of the names given for Schedulables within an experiment\&. To help identify individual entities, events and all other types of Schedulables, this class registers all names given to these objects\&. If an object is created with the same name as some other object before, a number is added to the object's name as a suffix\&. The number represents the amount of objects already created with that name\&.
