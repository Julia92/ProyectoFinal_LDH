.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Normally (also known as 'Gaussian') distributed stream of pseudo random numbers of type double\&. The algorithm used here is derived from the Java API class \fCjava\&.util\&.Random\fP and modified to also produce antithetic values if antithetic mode is switched on\&.

.SS "desmoj\&.core\&.dist\&.RealDistNormal\&.RealDistNormal (\fBModel\fPowner, Stringname, doublemean, doublestandardDeviation, booleanshowInReport, booleanshowInTrace)"
Creates a stream of pseud random numbers following a normal (also known as 'Gaussian') distribution\&. The specific mean and standard deviation values have to be given here at creation time\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP

\fIowner\fP Model : The distribution's owner 
.br
\fIname\fP java\&.lang\&.String : The distribution's name 
.br
\fImean\fP double : The mean value of the normal distribution 
.br
\fIstandardDeviation\fP double : The standard deviation for this distribution 
.br
\fIshowInReport\fP boolean : Flag for producing reports
