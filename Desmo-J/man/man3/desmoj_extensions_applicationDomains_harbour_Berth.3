.PP 
\fBBerth\fP is the place where ships are berthing until they will be unloaded and/or loaded\&. \fC\fBShip\fP\fP can come and \fC\fBtake()\fP\fP the needed length for his berthing\&. Each ship has to release the same length of the berth it once has acquired by calling the \fC\fBrelease()\fP\fP method of the \fBBerth\fP\&. \fBBerth\fP is used to implement process synchronization between ships, which are using berth\&. The berth has a limited ccertain length\&. A ship can take the needed for him length to berth\&. After his unloading and/or loading the ship must release the taken length to make her available to other ships\&. If a ship can not get the needed length (enough free place) for his berthing, it has to wait in a queue until enough length ( free palce) are released by other ships\&. A ship can release its berthing length anytime\&. After the berht has \fC\fBrelease()\fP\fP the used length the waiting queue is checked for ships waiting for her\&. The first sort criteria of the queue is always highest priorities first, the second queueing discipline of the underlying queue and the capacity limit can be determined by the user (default is FIFO and unlimited capacity)\&.

.SS "void desmoj\&.extensions\&.applicationDomains\&.harbour\&.Berth\&.activateFirst ()\fC [protected]\fP"
Activates the first process (ship) waiting in the queue\&. That is a process which was trying to take the needed length of the berth, but there was not enough left in the berth\&. Or another ship was first in the queue to be served\&. This method is called every time a process returns length to berth or when a ship in the waiting-queue is satisfied\&.

.SS "void desmoj\&.extensions\&.applicationDomains\&.harbour\&.Berth\&.changeLength (intl)"
Changes the length of the \fBBerth\fP\&. Sets the length of the berth that is max\&. available to l\&. l must be positive\&. This is only allowed as long as the \fBBerth\fP has not been used or the \fBBerth\fP has just been reset\&.
