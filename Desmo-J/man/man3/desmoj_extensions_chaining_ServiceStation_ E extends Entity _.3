.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The ServiceStation represents a standard operating station which can process entities\&. It has exacty the same behaviour like the Station but can be used in the modelling process due to no abstract modifier\&. This construct has its right to exist to have the possibility to implement further behaviour or extensions\&.

This Constructor sets the given times, initializes the queues and fills the free service capacity queue\&. If a given int is lower than zero the station assumes that there is no resriction\&. This applies to incomingBufferQueueCapacity, maxEntitiesToHandle, parallelHandledEntities
