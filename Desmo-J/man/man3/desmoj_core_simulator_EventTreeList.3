.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Alternative Implementation of the interface \fC\fBEventList\fP\fP using a tree-based list as a container for the event-notes, yielding both access and removal of event-list entries in O(log n) time\&.
.PP
Disadvantages compared to \fCEventVector\fP include non-thread-safeness (however, discrete Event simulation should never attempt concurrent modifications of the event-list) and the slightly higher memory requirement\&.
.PP
The internal tree-based list is provided by the class \fC\fBorg\&.apache\&.commons\&.collections\&.list\&.TreeList\fP\fP from the Commons Collections package from the Apache Jakarta Commons Project (see http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/index.html)\&.

Returns a string representing the entries of this tree list in a row\&. The resulting string includes all Event notes in ascending order as they are placed inside the event tree list\&.
