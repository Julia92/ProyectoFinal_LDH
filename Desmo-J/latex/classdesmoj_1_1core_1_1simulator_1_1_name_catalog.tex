\subsection{Detailed Description}
Keeps track of the names given for Schedulables within an experiment. To help identify individual entities, events and all other types of Schedulables, this class registers all names given to these objects. If an object is created with the same name as some other object before, a number is added to the object's name as a suffix. The number represents the amount of objects already created with that name.
