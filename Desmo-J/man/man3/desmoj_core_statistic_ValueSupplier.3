.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Supplies observers with values of their interest\&. It resembles the 'observable' part of the observer pattern as described in [Gamm95]\&. Thus it extends the standard 'Observable' class provided by the Java\&.util package\&. Usually, statistical data collectors are interested in the new value whenever a certain status variable of a simulation object changes\&. Also there are statistical evaluation systems, such as AKAROA, which extract information from several running simulations on different remote computers to gain better statistical data and finally, extracting values during runtime enables better visualizatioin of the simulation progress if these values are displayed using a graphical interface\&. There are two possible ways to have other objects register changes of another object's status: 
.PD 0

.IP "1." 4
Call the \fC'update(double value)'\fP method of an observer to pass the changed value directly to one other object interested\&. Using the direct call allows easy passing of a value to a single observer\&. No instance of this \fC\fBValueSupplier\fP\fP class is needed using direct passing of values\&. 
.IP "2." 4
Using the \fC\fBValueSupplier\fP\fP to publish the information to interested observers requires you to derive a class and implement the call of the observer's \fCupdate(Observable, Object)\fP method with the required values\&. This way of passing values involves more code to be written, but offer the potential to have multiple observers and change the number of observers during runtime\&. These options are not available when using the simpler version above\&.

.SS "desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.ValueSupplier\&.ValueSupplier (Stringname)"
Constructs a simple valuesupplier by giving it a name\&. 
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "String desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.ValueSupplier\&.getName ()"
Returns the name of the named object\&. This is the same name displayed in reports and trace files when this named object is shown in those reports or trace files\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
java\&.lang\&.String : The name of the named object 
.RE
.PP

.SS "String desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.ValueSupplier\&.getQuotedName ()"
Returns the quoted name of the named object\&. This is the name displayed in reports and trace files when this named object is shown\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
java\&.lang\&.String : The quoted name of the named object 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.ValueSupplier\&.notifyStatistics (Objectarg)"
Indicates that this \fBValueSupplier\fP (as an Observable) has changed and notifies all its observers of this change providing the modified value as parameter\&. This is the 'Push-model', thus pushing the value (in the parameter \fCarg\fP) to the Observer (thus the \fC\fBStatisticObject\fP\fP)\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIarg\fP Object : The Object wrapping the value with which the observers will be updated 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.ValueSupplier\&.rename (StringnewName)"
Changes the name of the named object\&. This might be necessary for automatically created named object of a user defined model, but should not be used for elements of the framework or basic objects of the user model\&. Changing names of objects while runtime will confuse any trace output and generally make traces more difficult if not impossible to follow\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fInewName\fP java\&.lang\&.String : The new name for the named object 
.RE
.PP

.SS "String desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.ValueSupplier\&.toString ()"
Overrides the java\&.lang\&.Object's toString method to return the named object's name when given as parameter to a method that expects a string to be passed\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
java\&.lang\&.String : The named object's name 
.RE
.PP

.SS "abstract double desmoj\&.core\&.statistic\&.ValueSupplier\&.value ()\fC [pure virtual]\fP"
When using the Pull-Model or the automatic update function this method must be overridden by the user in a way that it provides the value (as a \fCdouble\fP) desired\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
double : The value calculated within this method\&.
