\subsection{Detailed Description}
This interface describes the set of methods an event-\/list carrying the scheduled events and entities in a temporal order has to implement. This is a part of the framework that does not have to be implemented by the user in order to get a simulation running, since the scheduler already uses the class Event\-Vector as default \doxyref{Event\-List}{p.}{classdesmoj_1_1core_1_1simulator_1_1_event_list} construction. Since each step in the discrete simulation requires searching and manipulating the event-\/list, this is probably one of the best places in the framework to optimize execution performance. Especially if special models show specific behaviour i.\-e. primarily inserting new events at the very end of the event-\/list, other implementations of the event-\/list might support faster access times.
