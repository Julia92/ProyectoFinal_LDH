.PP 
The \fBGates\fP is a place on a container terminal where the \fC\fBTruck\fP\fP s enter and leave the terminal\&. It has a ceratin number of the entrance and exit lanes\&. Both must be not negative\&. The lanes are implemented as \fCRes\fP with FIFO-strategy and unlimited capacity\&. The \fBGates\fP is derived from ModelComponent\&.
