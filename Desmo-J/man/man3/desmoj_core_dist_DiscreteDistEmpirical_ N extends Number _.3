.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Empirically distributed stream of pseudo random numbers of a custom type\&. Values produced by this distribution follow an empirical distribution which is specified by entries consisting of the observed value and the frequency (probability) this value has been observed to occur\&. These entries are made by using the \fC\fBaddEntry()\fP\fP method\&.

.SS "desmoj\&.core\&.dist\&.DiscreteDistEmpirical< N extends Number >\&.DiscreteDistEmpirical (\fBModel\fPowner, Stringname, booleanshowInReport, booleanshowInTrace)"
Constructs an empirical distribution producing double values\&. Empirical distributions have to be initialized manually before use\&. This is done by calling the \fCaddEntry(double, double)\fP method to add values defining the behaviour of the desired distribution\&.s
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIowner\fP Model : The distribution's owner 
.br
\fIname\fP java\&.lang\&.String : The distribution's name 
.br
\fIshowInReport\fP boolean : Flag for producing reports 
.br
\fIshowInTrace\fP boolean : Flag for producing trace output

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.dist\&.DiscreteDistEmpirical< N extends Number >\&.addEntry (Nvalue, doublefrequency)"
Adds a new entry of an empirical value and its associated frequency\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIvalue\fP N : The empirical value observed 
.br
\fIfrequency\fP double : The corresponding frequency of the empirical value

.SS "\fBdesmoj\&.core\&.report\&.Reporter\fP desmoj\&.core\&.dist\&.DiscreteDistEmpirical< N extends Number >\&.createReporter ()"
Creates the default reporter for the EmpiricalDiscreteDist distribution\&.

Reporter : The reporter for the EmpiricalDiscreteDist distribution

.SS "boolean desmoj\&.core\&.dist\&.DiscreteDistEmpirical< N extends Number >\&.isInitialized ()"
Shows if the EmpiricalDiscreteDist distribution already is initialized\&. Being initialized means that at least one value has already been added via the \fCaddEntry(double, double)\fP method\&.

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.dist\&.DiscreteDistEmpirical< N extends Number >\&.removeEntry (Nvalue)"
Removes all entries of an empirical value\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIvalue\fP N : The value to be removed 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.dist\&.DiscreteDistEmpirical< N extends Number >\&.removeEntry (Nvalue, doubletolerance)"
Removes all entries of all empirical values close to a given value\&. This method is useful for removing floating point values whose internal precision may be subject to rounding errors and depend on the JVM in use\&.
.br
 Example: In a DiscreteDistEmprirical<Double> after calling \fCaddEntriy(42\&.42, 5)\fP, you might find the value actually stored is 42\&.42000000000001\&. To remove this entry independently of its precise internal representation, use e\&.g\&. \fCremoveEntry(42\&.42, 0\&.0001)\fP\&. (This assumes all other values stored in this distribution differ by more than 0\&.001 from 42\&.42\&.)
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIvalue\fP N : The value to be removed 
.br
\fItolerance\fP double : The value to be removed

.SS "N desmoj\&.core\&.dist\&.DiscreteDistEmpirical< N extends Number >\&.sample ()"
Returns the next sample specified by the empirical distribution\&. In contrast to \fBRealDistEmpirical\fP here is no interpolation needed\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
N : The next sample for this empirical distribution or returns zero (0) with a warning if the distribution has not been properly initialized yet
