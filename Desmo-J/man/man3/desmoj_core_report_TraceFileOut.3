.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
\fBTraceFileOut\fP is used to create a file to write the tracemessages to\&. It receives a tracemessage and divides its individual text information up to be displayed in HTML format on disc in the user's local directory\&. The messages are displayed in a tabular design with columns for: 
.PD 0

.IP "\(bu" 2
The point of simulation time the tracemessage was created 
.IP "\(bu" 2
The entity's name responsible for sending the tracemessage or '-' in case of an external event 
.IP "\(bu" 2
The event associated with the entity or '-' in case of a SimProcess  
.IP "\(bu" 2
The textual description of what has happened to the model state 
.PP
Note that if the framework is used as an applet in webpages there is no access to the disc and an alternative output on screen or into a graphics window must be registered at the experiment's messagemanager for this type of messages\&. Errors affecting the java runtime are always displayed on the system's standard output printstream\&.

.PP 
.SS "desmoj\&.core\&.report\&.TraceFileOut\&.TraceFileOut (intsimTimeFloatingDigits, Stringformat)"
Creates a TraceOut to print tracemessages into a HTML page\&. By opening the file, the necessary HTML tags to define a webpage are already inserted into the file\&. The parameter given should reflect the experiment that produces this file\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIsimTimeFloatingDigits\fP int : The number of floating point digits of the simulation time values to be displayed

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.report\&.TraceFileOut\&.close ()"
Closes this TraceOut\&. Writes the final necessary HTML-tags to close a table row, the table and finish the HTML-page\&. Flushes and closes the FileOutputStream thereafter\&. 
.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.report\&.TraceFileOut\&.open (Stringname)"
Opens a new file with the given file- and pathname for writing tracenotes into a HTML table\&. The output path is set to the working directory\&. If no String is given, the default filename 'DESMOJ_tracefile\&.html' is used\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIname\fP java\&.lang\&.String : The name of the file to be created 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.report\&.TraceFileOut\&.open (Stringpathname, Stringname)"
Opens a new file with the given file- and pathname for writing tracenotes into a HTML table\&. If no String is given, the default filename 'DESMOJ_tracefile\&.html' is used\&. If no pathname is given the current working directory (stored as property 'user\&.dir') is used\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIname\fP java\&.lang\&.String : The name of the file to be created 
.br
\fIpathname\fP java\&.lang\&.String: The name of the output path for the file

.PP

.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.report\&.TraceFileOut\&.receive (\fBMessage\fPm)"
Receives a \fBTraceNote\fP and writes its contents formatted to a HTML table into a file in the user's default directory\&. Note that although any type of message may be given to this method, only tracenotes will be processed\&. If other types of messages are given to this method, it will simply return doing nothing\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIm\fP \fBMessage\fP : The \fBTraceNote\fP to be written to file in HTML-table format

Implements \fBdesmoj\&.core\&.report\&.MessageReceiver\fP\&.
.SS "void desmoj\&.core\&.report\&.TraceFileOut\&.receive (\fBdesmoj\&.core\&.report\&.Reporter\fPr)"
Reporters are not handled by this class so this method simply returns\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIr\fP \fBReporter\fP : The reporter to be processed
