.PP 
Exception is thrown to indicate that the simulation has been forced to stop becaus of an error that occured\&. The error forcing a disruption of the simulation is described in the error message attached to this exception\&. Users must not make use of it nor is this exception supposed to be caught by users\&. Its use inside the DESMOJ framework is transparent because it is derived from \fCRuntimeException\fP which isthe root for a tree of exceptions that are automatically rethrown by any Java method thus not needing to be rethrown by the user, too\&.
