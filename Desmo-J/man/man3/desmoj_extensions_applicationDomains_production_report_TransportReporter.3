Constructor for a new \fBTransportReporter\fP\&. Note that although any Reportable is accepted you should make sure that only subtypes of \fBTransportJunction\fP are passed to this constructor\&. Otherwise the number of column titles and their individual headings will differ from the actual content collected by this reporter\&.

Returns an array of Strings each containing the data for the corresponding column in array \fCcolumns[]\fP\&. This method is fetching the data from the master (transporter) and slave (goods) queue\&. Implement this method in a way, that an array of the same length as the columntitles is produced containing the data at the point of time this method is called by someone else to produce up-to-date information\&.
